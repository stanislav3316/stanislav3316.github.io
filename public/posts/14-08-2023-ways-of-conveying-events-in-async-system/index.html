<p>In Webhooks case, service sends events on specified/registered REST endpoint, so that app could process them.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>

<li>implementing Webhooks is often straightforward, requiring a simple HTTP POST request to the configured endpoint</li>

</p>
<p>In the case of polling, an external system or application periodically makes GET requests to the /events endpoint to retrieve the latest events.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementing polling is relatively simple, as it only involves making regular requests to a specific endpoint</li>
<li>the client has control over when to fetch new data, making it easy to manage data retrieval based on its specific needs</li>
<li>an effective integration pattern for external systems: polling can work with a wide range of systems and technologies</li>
<li>no extra complexity in your architecture and operational overhead</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>cases of network and external service outages should be addressed with extended retry mechanisms</li>
<li>polling introduces latency</li>
<li>frequent polling can result in unnecessary network traffic</li>
<li>polling is not suitable for real-time applications where immediate data updates are required</li>

</p>
<p>In the case of WebSocket (WS), Server-Sent Events (SSE), or HTTP/2.0, external systems or applications establish long-lived connections to receive an event stream.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>long-lived connections enable real-time data updates, making them ideal for applications requiring instant notifications and live data feeds</li>
<li>these technologies are designed for low-latency communication</li>
<li>implementing long-lived connections can be simpler than managing complex polling or callback mechanisms</li>
<li>no extra complexity in your architecture and operational overhead</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>you need to carefully consider the logic for acknowledging events to guarantee delivery</li>
<li>you need to consider implementing ping/pong messages to allow the connection to be closed in the event of prolonged inactivity</li>
<li>organizing retry logic can be challenging</li>
<li>implementing and managing long-lived connections can be more complex than traditional request-response mechanisms, especially when dealing with reconnects and error handling</li>
<li>both clients and servers must maintain open connections, which can consume resources</li>
<li>long-lived connections may encounter issues with certain network configurations, firewalls, and proxies, potentially requiring additional configuration</li>
